# Blanco offline order app

Static, offline-capable ordering tool for Blanco Clothing. The UI and logic live in `index.html` so the app can run from any static host with no API dependencies.

## Running the app

Use Vite's static dev server for local testing:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can also serve the built files directly with any HTTP server (for example `python -m http.server`).

## Building the app

```bash
npm run build
```
